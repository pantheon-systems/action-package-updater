A GitHub action that monitors a list of PHP extensions and opens PRs if newer versions exist. Monitors a `dependencies.yml` file that defines the current (known) tags and the (GitHub) repository and will check to see if updates are available. 

Optionally, this can be used to _also_ update version variables declared in a bash script based on those versions that are updated in `dependencies.yml`. Currently, an example of the expected syntax can be found in [`./fixtures/PHP_EXTENSION_VERSIONS`](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/action-package-updater/blob/main/fixtures/PHP_EXTENSION_VERSIONS).

## Inputs
### `dependencies-yml`
**Required** The path to your `dependencies.yml` file. A valid `dependencies.yml` file is required and the action expects that you define the path to the file.

### `output-file`
An optional _additional_ file to update version numbers on based on updated versions in `dependencies.yml`. See [`./fixtures/PHP_EXTENSION_VERSIONS`](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/action-package-updater/blob/main/fixtures/PHP_EXTENSION_VERSIONS) for a current example of a valid `output-file`. In the future, additional use cases may be added.

### `default-branch`
The name of default branch of the repository running the GitHub Action. Defaults to `main` -- if your repository is using `master` or some other pattern for the repository's default branch, you _must_ define this value.

### `dry-run`
Whether to run the action without actually pushing any changes to the repository. If left at the default (`false`), a PR will be created. If you would like to evaluate the output of the changes first, you can run the script with `dry-run` set to `true` and you will see output similar [this test run](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/action-package-updater/actions/runs/5534246116/jobs/10098927317#step:3:119)

## Example Usage
A full example `yml` file is illustrated below:

```yaml
name: Package Updater
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
jobs:
  updater:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run Package Updater
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pantheon-systems/action-package-updater@v1
        with:
          dependencies-yml: ./dependencies.yml
```

### Running on a Schedule
This action is designed to be run on a cron schedule. In the example above, we're running the action once daily at midnight. For more information about the `schedule` trigger, refer to the [Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) documentation.

### `dependencies.yml`
The `dependencies.yml` file expects a specific schema and validates that schema as part of the action run. An example `dependencies.yml` file can be referenced below:

```yaml
dependencies:
  yq:
    current_tag: v4.34.2
    repo: mikefarah/yq
    pr_note: "This note will be appended to any new pull request."

```

Currently, the action supports GitHub projects exclusively. In the future, we may extend the `repo` key to allow other repositories to check as well. The `current_tag` value will be updated as part of the action and must match how those tags or releases exist in the repository. Similarly, a repository with the `<author>/<project>` defined in the `repo` field ust already exist.
